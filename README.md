Lastly user is prompted which the program/command integration to type down the command and all that is saved 
with command in a self-executable batch file named "final.bat".


assgn-q3
Uses Open Gl lib and Glut Utility 
Prerequisites - From assgn-q3/necessary-files/..
                save glut.h ----------->  MinGW32 (your compiler)/include/GL/
                save libglut32.a------->  MinGW32 (your compiler)/lib
                save glut32.dll-------->  C:\Windows\System32 or Where your .exe is kept
                
               use these commands while compiling
               -lglu32 -lglut32 -lopengl32
             
Program is a typical Open gl program using glut for windowing and creating octahedron while 
gl is used for rendering purpose.
